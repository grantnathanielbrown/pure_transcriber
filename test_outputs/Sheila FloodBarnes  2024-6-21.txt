Sheila FloodBarnes                                          June 21, 2024

Hello, this is Dr. Kerr. I'm dictating a progress note. This progress note does not need letterhead. It's on Sheila, S-H-E-I-L-A, Flood, F-L-O-O-D, Barnes, B-A-R-N-E-S, Sheila, Flood, Barnes. And it's from June 20th. Ms. Barnes did her appointment by telephone from a parking lot at the corner of Balls, B-A-L-L-S, Hill, H-I-L-L, Road, R-O-A-D, in McLean, Virginia.

She complained of ongoing headache, ataxia, A-T-A-X-I-A, and cognitive compromise with word-finding difficulty. An example is she's having difficulty unlocking her phone. Those symptoms have persisted since she had TIA approximately two and a half weeks ago.

She saw her primary care physician following a brief hospitalization for the TIA. She said that was not helpful. He did not order any medications or tests.

She did see her neurologist in follow-up after leaving the hospital. Her neurologist ordered an ambulatory and continuous EEG. The patient has had some scheduling difficulties because of insurance obstacles and has not yet completed those tests. She has a follow-up appointment with her neurologist on July 5th. She said she may have to postpone that follow-up appointment because she will not have had her EEGs yet.

She has started gabapentin for the headache, which she said has not been helpful.

She complained of some depressed mood and disappointment with some anxiety about her health following the TIA. She said her anxiety has improved since she has taken two weeks off work because she is not under pressure to perform and function cognitively in the workplace.

She did report that she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was started on a macro-bid.

She denied suicidal ideas or hopelessness. She expressed a desire to deal with her second TIA by investing more time and energy in self-care. She said she is interested in exercising, eating more healthily, and trying to improve her sleep hygiene in an effort to reduce her cardiovascular risk factors. She said she has some guilty feelings about self-care and has a self-image of a caregiver for others. We did some psychotherapy to address those obstacles and did some cognitive reframing. We worked on helping her to reset her priorities.

She sees a cognitive behavioral therapist every other week. That therapist had done some neuropsychological testing in the office. According to the patient results, the testing indicated that the patient may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I have requested copies of the report. The patient has not been successful in obtaining copies or having the therapist send them to me. Ms. Flood-Barnes authorized me to contact her therapist directly. She gave me the contact information for the paratherapist and asked me to contact her directly to request the results of the testing. The therapist's name is Reggie, R-E-G-I, A-B-U-L-A-S-H.

Ms. Flood gives a history of restlessness with some difficulty with focus. She said she has had it for quite some time. She's described it as intermittent and says that it waxes and wanes. She did say that it is associated with anxiety. According to the patient, she took a TOVA, T-O-V-A test. She also took a Beck Depression Scale and a Beck Anxiety Scale at my office two weeks ago, which had significantly high scores. I will need to review the testing from her other therapist and evaluate it in the context of her depression and anxiety, which could be contributing significantly to restlessness and poor concentration.

We did discuss treatment options for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as differential diagnosis. I talked with her about poor concentration and possible causes, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, and sleep deprivation.

We discussed treatments including stimulants, Welbutrin, non-stimulant medications such as Stratera, Clonidine, Guanfacine, and Modafinil. Indications, potential risks, benefits, and side effects of those medications were discussed. I did talk with her about indications for stimulants including ADD and ADHD. I explained that potential risks are exacerbation of anxiety, triggering of hypomanic episodes, or insomnia, or tachycardia. I also pointed out that there's a potential for diversion and that they are used as performance enhancers.

We discussed non-stimulant medications for ADD and ADHD, such as Stratera. She has had a trial of Welbutrin that was not helpful for depression. I talked with her about Guanfacine and Clonidine, which are anti-hypertensives and are sedating, which could potentially be helpful for her if indeed she is diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. We also briefly discussed Modafinil, which has some potential benefits in ADD and ADHD.

We agreed that I should contact her therapist to try to get a report of her assessment.

She continues on Imipramine for depression. She has had a partial response. It has been difficult to assess her Imipramine response in the context of her TIA and subsequent residual symptoms. We discussed her transitioning to a greater focus on self-care and doing psychotherapy to deal with emotional obstacles.

1. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features. She will continue on Imipramine and continue with every other week psychotherapy with me and every other week therapy with a cognitive behavioral therapist. She does have significant depressive symptoms. She did deny any suicidal ideas and is hopeful about the future. We will consider a serum Imipramine level if she needs a dosage adjustment.
2. Generalized anxiety disorder. She is managing her anxiety around her TIA. I'll continue to recommend exercise and sleep hygiene and continue with Imipramine.
3. Binge eating disorder. She is not binging.
4. Mixed personality disorder. We will continue with psychotherapies.
5. Migraines. She has a significant headache that is treated with gabapentin. She is not having any side effects. She has follow-up scheduled with her neurologist.
6. Osteoporosis is stable.
7. Thyroid nodules followed by her endocrinologist.
8. History of tardive dyskinesia. I did evaluate her in person two weeks ago at her appointment in the office. Her symptoms are very minimal and do not require medication intervention.
