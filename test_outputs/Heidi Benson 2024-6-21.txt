This is Dr. Kerr. I'm dictating a progress note. This progress note does not need letterhead. This is Dr. Kerr. I'm dictating a progress note. This progress note does not need letterhead. It's on Heidi Benson, D-E-N-S-O-N, Heidi Benson, and it's from June 21st. Ms. Benson did her appointment on a HIPAA-compliant encrypted platform from her home in Warrington, W-R-R-E-N-T-O-N, Virginia. She complained of disappointment that she was not able to get either of the two overseas positions she had applied for. She said she was dealing with adjusting to working in the United States in her current position in her current workplace in 2025. She denied any hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, or insomnia or suicidal thoughts.

She requested a refill for Concerta. We evaluated her Concerta use. "I can tell when I take it. It's easier for me to focus. I can focus on writing for longer periods of time and it's easier for me to pay attention. When I don't take it, I'm more distracted and it's hard to sit in one place." She denied chest pain or palpitations or shortness of breath. She did complain of more restlessness if she does not take the Concerta.

Her last EKG was in November of 2022 when she was having a preoperative workup for electroconvulsive therapy.

Her last annual physical exam with her primary care physician was July 14th of 2023. At that time, she had normal liver functions, a hemoglobin A1c of 4.8, a TSH of 2.2, a normal CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel, a normal vitamin D, a slightly elevated ferritin, and a normal pap smear. At that time, she did have an abnormal lipid panel which showed an elevated cholesterol of 233, normal triglycerides, a normal HDL of 64, an elevated LDL of 150, and a normal VLDL of 19.

We talked about her weight gain and deterioration of her lipid panel. We discussed them as cardiac risk factors. She said her clothes are tighter. She has not gotten on a scale because she doesn't own one. "I eat pretty badly. I eat a lot of prepared food and restaurant food." We discussed diet options, including consulting with a dietician, subscribing to a food delivery service where she could choose a low-fat, low-cholesterol, low-calorie menu or hiring a private cook. She said she is willing to consider a food service or a dietitian. I referred her to dietitian Carla, C-A-R-L-A, Sidhu, S-I-D-H-U.

I reviewed her chart. Her primary care physician did order an EKG at her annual physical on July 14, 2023, but no EKG was completed. The patient was non-compliant. I ordered an EKG today for a routine monitoring of her Concerta.

My impression is that she is getting benefit from her Venlafaxine and Ritrazapine. She continues on Metformin to try to minimize weight gain. She does need more aggressive intervention to manage her weight because of her lipid elevation. She's probably getting some appetite suppression from the Concerta. She does need an EKG for monitoring.

I will check her blood pressure because of the Concerta and Venlafaxine. Her primary care physician did recommend that she get serine ferritin since she had an elevated serum ferritin.

1. Major depressive disorder. Her depressed mood is in remission with Venlafaxine and Remeron and weekly psychotherapy.
2. Trichotillomania. She does still have some anxiety that is managed with a low dose of clonazepam. She has not needed to escalate the dose and does not ever ask for prescriptions early. I feel that the risk of diversion is low to zero.
3. Primary insomnia disorder is improved with Remeron. We will try to manage her weight gain with a dietician or food service program, as well as metformin.
4. Stickler syndrome is stable. That's S-T-I-C-K-L-E-R-S.
5. Cataracts and retinal detachment are followed by her ophthalmologist.
6. ADD. She'll continue on Conserva and I will order an EKG.
7. Low vitamin D. She had a normal vitamin D in July of 2023. I did remind her that she needs an annual physical and that she should schedule that as soon as possible.
8. Osteoporosis. She should have her vitamin D checked again because that can be a contributor to bone health.
