Eric Williamson                                          June 21, 2024

Hello, this is Dr. Kerr. I'm dictating a progress note. This progress note does not need letterhead. It's on Eric Williamson, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S-O-N, Eric Williamson, and it's from June 21st. This is a progress note. It does not need letterhead. Mr. Williamson did his appointment on a HIPAA compliant encrypted platform from his home in Fairfax, Virginia. He denied anxiety. His migraine headaches have resolved. He complained of some depressed mood and negative automatic thoughts after his family left from their visit. He endorsed brief fleeting impulses to self-harm. He denied any intent or plan to act on them. "I was able to recognize them and turn them off immediately." He denied decreased energy or sleep disturbance. He denied any thoughts of harming others.

He managed his feelings by taking a day off during the week to rest. He also was able to use cognitive reframing to deal with all-or-nothing thinking and globalization. He said that the rest on Wednesday helped resolve tension he had experienced during his parents' visit. His migraine headache also resolved. He did try using the treadmill in his basement. He described being able to use it for approximately 10 minutes at a time because he had to stop to use his computer.

We evaluated his medication. He did not feel that modafinil was necessary to maintain energy. He denied any afternoon fatigue. He felt that his brief episodes of depressed mood are improving and have continued to resolve since he no longer has house guests. We agreed not to make any changes in his antidepressant medication.

1. Generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks. He experienced some anxiety and muscle tension when his family was visiting. That anxiety was accompanied by a migraine. All of those symptoms have gradually resolved since his family is no longer visiting. We agreed that he no longer has any target symptoms, suggesting the need for change in his medication dose. He continues on a low dose of Klonopin as well as Gabapentin.
2. Undifferentiated depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. He had some residual depressed mood and some fleeting thoughts of self-harm. He denied any intention to act on them. He was able to manage those with cognitive behavioral strategies. We agreed to continue with Welbutrin, Cymbalta, and weekly psychotherapy.
3. Somatization disorder. He has no somatic preoccupation.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea. We agreed he does not need Modafinil in the afternoon. He continues with CPAP at night. He's incorporating exercise into his work routine.
5. Hypertension was not addressed today. He does monitor his blood pressure on a regular basis and is on an antihypertensive.
6. Diabetes and hypercholesterolemia were not addressed today.
7. Thalassemia is stable.
8. Migraine headaches. His migraine is resolving without further treatment.
